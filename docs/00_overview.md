# Overview

Quant-EAM is an "Experience Asset Management" system for quant research: turn ideas into audited, replayable evidence (dossiers), and manage what is allowed into the registry/composer under strict governance.

## Scope

### In Scope

- A deterministic kernel for execution, evaluation, and auditing (no hidden network IO; reproducible runs).
- A dossier-first evidence model: artifacts and structured summaries are the SSOT for UI and review.
- Agents as harnessed tools: proposal generation and analysis helpers, never final arbiters.
- Protocols and governance that prevent drift (contracts/policies/holdout boundaries).

### Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

- No "script-driven bypass": do not allow arbitrary backtest scripts to run without compiler/kernel governance.
- No online dependency at runtime for core runs (no external API required to start or pass tests).
- No leaking of final holdout details into iterative loops.

## Glossary (Terms)

- **IdeaSpec**: a human-readable description of an idea/hypothesis and intended evaluation.
- **Blueprint**: a declarative, versioned strategy specification (DSL). Not executable code.
- **RunSpec**: a fully resolved execution plan: data sources/as-of, policy_ids, seeds, and parameters.
- **Dossier**: an append-only evidence bundle generated by the kernel (artifacts + structured metadata).
- **GateResults**: PASS/FAIL outcomes with references to dossier evidence and policy_ids used.
- **Holdout**: a protected evaluation space. It returns only pass/fail and minimal summary.
- **Experience Card**: a registry entry that points to one or more dossiers and key outcomes.
- **Diagnostics**: declarative diagnostic procedures (DiagnosticSpec) that can be promoted into gates.

## Whole View (Simplified)

1) Idea -> IdeaSpec
2) Blueprint proposal (agent) -> Blueprint review (human)
3) Pseudocode / VarDict review (human)
4) Demo trace (kernel) -> dossier evidence
5) Backtest (kernel) -> dossier evidence
6) Gates run (kernel) -> GateResults (PASS/FAIL with artifacts refs)
7) Registry write (append-only) -> Experience Card
8) Composer consumes registry (policy-constrained)

Key rule: anything shown in UI must be derived from dossier + gate results, not from ad-hoc logs or source code inspection.
