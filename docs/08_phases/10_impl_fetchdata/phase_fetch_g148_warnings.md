## Architecture
- Single SSOT source: docs/12_workflows/skeleton_ssot_v1.yaml
- Requirement-gap-only planning path.
- Interface-first dependency gate for impl goals.

## DoD
- Acceptance commands pass.
- Packet validator passes.
- SSOT writeback marks linked requirement implemented.

## Implementation Plan
TBD by controller at execution time.
